Plans of today - 
*Upload all shit on Git
*Backup on harddrive

Total setup decision:

- 2* Puredata. One on Midichannel 1, the other on midichannel 2.
- Midithrough on the two different patches needs to be set to the needed out-channel (1 for notes, 2 for video)
^^^^ DOESNT WORK ^^^^^^^^^^^

- 1* Puredata & 1 time yamaha reface CS. Channel makes no difference.
